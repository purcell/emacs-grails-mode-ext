#+TITLE: Emacs Projectile Mode

This project provides basic [[http://grails.org][Grails]] support for Emacs.
There are 2 packages (*project-mode support is unmaintained*):
- Grails support using [[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile][Projectile]] as project management system.
- Grails support on top of the existing [[https://github.com/kurtharriger/emacs-grails-mode][grails-mode]], which uses [[https://code.google.com/p/emacs-project-mode/][project-mode]] (obsolete).

Projectile support is newer and recommended.

* Features

- You can run pre-defined or arbitrary Grails commands for a project with easy shortcuts.
- You can browse documentation (main documentation page, guide, apidocs).
- Custom JVM options to pass to the Grails command are supported at a global level.
- Custom command line options to pass to Grails by default.
- You can use the Grails wrapper by default whenever available for a project.
- For grails-projectile, customization group called *grails-projectile* that is accessible via =M-x customize-group=.
- Lookup functions are available to quickly visit controllers, services, etc.
- Menubar contributions for common commands.
- You can create a =.grails-projectile= file at the root of the project for default project specific JVM options.

* Dependencies installation

It is recommended to use the [[http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/ELPA][package system]] to install dependencies.
You'll likely want to start with =groovy-mode=.

** Projectile
[[https://github.com/bbatsov/projectile/][Projectile]] is a nice way to manage projects in Emacs.
=M-x package-install projectile [RET]=

** Groovy mode
[[https://github.com/Groovy-Emacs-Modes/groovy-emacs-modes][Groovy-mode]] brings you Groovy syntax highlighting.
=M-x package-install groovy-mode [RET]=

* Commands
** Minor mode prefix
The default key prefix is =C-c ;=. This can be changed by
customizing the =grails-projectile-keymap-prefix= variable.

** Interactive commands

Below is the list of available interactive commands.
