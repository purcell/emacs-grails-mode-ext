# Emacs Grails Mode Extensions

Simple(one-time) contribution to the existing Emacs [grails-mode](https://github.com/kurtharriger/emacs-grails-mode).

## Features
* You can run pre-defined or arbitrary Grails commands for a project
* You can browse documentation (wiki, guide, apidocs)
* Menubar contributions in Grails mode

Note: Not all commands are added to the menubar. 
All available functions start with *grails/* (grails followed by slash).

## Dependencies

This project depends on [grails-mode](https://github.com/kurtharriger/emacs-grails-mode).

## Configuration

Append the following lines to your emacs startup file:

```lisp
;; Assuming that emacs-grails-mode-ext.el is in ~/.emacs.d/vendor
(setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/vendor") load-path))
(require 'emacs-grails-mode-ext)
```

Additional setup for file associations (requires [groovy-mode](https://github.com/timvisher/emacs-groovy-mode-mirror)) :

```lisp
(autoload 'groovy-mode "groovy-mode" "Mode for editing Groovy source files")
(autoload 'nxml-mode "nxml-mode" "Mode for editing GSP pages")

(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\.gsp$" . nxml-mode)) 
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\.groovy$" . groovy-mode)) 
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\.gradle$" . groovy-mode)) 
```

The Grails mode version available at [https://github.com/timvisher/emacs-groovy-mode-mirror](https://github.com/timvisher/emacs-groovy-mode-mirror) is old, I'm using kurtharriger's version.
You only need the Groovy mode related files.

You may want to filter the output of Grails commands in the shell as described [here](http://www.redtoad.ca/ataylor/2011/09/grails-2-0-and-emacs-shell-mode/).
